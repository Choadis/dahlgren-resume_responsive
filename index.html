    <p class="obj-cont"> My goals are very simple, in my opinion. I'd very much like to find a job in the tech industry, and start a small family with my fiance. To do this, I need to finish my education at Thaddeus and apply myself to learning and excelling in all material presented to me. Simply put, my goal is to be the best I can be at what I enjoy doing.</p>
